AntiPorn - Blocking Porno Sites. Wait for more...

# Anti Porn HOSTS File
The purpose of this repository is to distribute a useful mean to fight porn addiction.

If you are willing to improve your life and get rid of porn addiction then Google [`@NoFap`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoFap)

## What's the HOSTS file and how it can prevent access to porn sites?
HOSTS file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names.

With HOSTS file we can prevent our browser to access porn sites.

## What's so special about this repository?
PornHosts contains a huge list of porn sites (probably the biggest list you can find on the Internet).

Just by copy-pasting its content on your machine's HOSTS file enables the blocking mechanism.

## HOSTS in Windows 7/8.x/10
1. Right mouse click on Notepad icon then click on `Run as administrator`
2. File â†’ Open... then insert the path `C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`
3. Add a new line and copy-paste the entire content of HOSTS.txt
4. Save
5. Reboot

## HOSTS in Linux and macOS
1. Open the terminal
2. Type `sudo vim /etc/hosts`
3. Add a new line and copy-paste the entire content of HOSTS.txt
4. Save
5. Reboot

## Make a promise
Once the mechanism is in place and working, do not disable it.

If you disable it on demand to watch porns then you defeat the very purpose of it, but more than that you betray yourself.
