## The iniquity of a seed to nullify causes several things in man himself and in the higher worlds


- The cause of the separation of the human soul from the divine light that animates it, this is called in the language of the Torah "Crete" (detailed below).

- This iniquity causes a disconnect between man and the Creator of the world to such an extent that it is written that there is a "wall" separating him from the name for 40 days (If intentionally).

### In the human psyche:
- The cause of the separation of the human soul from the divine light that animates it, this is called in the language of the Torah "Crete" (detailed below).
- This iniquity causes a disconnect between man and the Creator of the world to such an extent that it is written that there is a "wall" separating him from the name for 40 days (intentionally).
- Causes a diminution of the divine abundance in man, most often this will be felt in sadness and post-act depression.
- Causes strong self-hatred - even if not immediately.
- Causes a minority in livelihoods and the destruction of livelihoods - and even causes real poverty!
- Problems with the peace of home and the woman's distance from her husband.
- Puts himself in excommunication (even just by hardening the limb) - so that his prayers are not heard for 40 days (unless he repents - and it is also recommended to allow vows)
- Does not receive redemption and resurrection and the seventh millennium!
- Fear him from heaven.
- D. Unclean husks rule over him.
- Bad qualities will cling to him.
- The springs of Torah wisdom were blocked from it.
- Condemned in boiling feces.
- Convicted of beating the grave.
- Begets wicked sons.
- Causes the rains to stop, by stopping the next abundance to the world.
- Even born in good luck, his luck becomes bad as we have seen: everything depends on luck - good luck.
- Causes the delay of Messiah and redemption.

### In the upper worlds:
- Causes a screen between him and the name.
- Causes the removal of the light of the Divine from the world.
- Causes holy souls to enter the shell section and instead of wearing in this world a holy body of a Jew - to wear an unclean spiritual body from the shell section so that the same soul falls into a filth that is very difficult to get out of.
- Causes the degree of law to rule the world.
